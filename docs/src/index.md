# Overview

LikelihoodProfiler is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) package for identifiability analysis and confidence intervals estimation.

## Installation

In Julia terminal, run the following command:

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("LikelihoodProfiler")
```

## Methods

LikelihoodProfiler.jl provides a single interface to various methods of profile likelihood-based practical identifiability: 
- Confidence intervals by Constrained Optimization method (CICO)
- Optimization-based likelihood profiles
- Integration-based likelihood profiles
- Hybrid approaches
